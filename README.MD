# Show Durability

Show Durability is a Fabric mod that displays the durability of items in inventories and in the hotbar directly on the item with a number.
The durability display can be toggled with a keybind (B by default).
The mod requires Fabric API to be installed (since version 1.1.0), and should only be installed on the client.
It works in singleplayer and multiplayer.
